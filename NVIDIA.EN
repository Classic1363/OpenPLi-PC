I noticed that installing the nvidia proprietary driver on ssd with distributives 19.10 and 20.04(dev) isn't correct. 
After the second reboot, xserver doesn't start. At the same time, when installing on hdd there are no such problems.
The solution is to modify /etc/gdm3/custom.conf. Uncomment the next line:
#Wayland = false
So now the line will look like this:
Wayland = false
Save and restart your PC.
